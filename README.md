# DATA 221 Assignment 2

This repository contains solutions for Assignment 2 of the DATA 221 course. Each notebook corresponds to one question and can be run independently.  

## File Structure

### Notebooks
- `Question_1.ipynb`  
  Reads`sample-file.txt`, cleans tokens (lowercase + strip punctuation), and prints the **top 10** most frequent words.

- `Question_2.ipynb`  
  Uses the same cleaning rules as Q1 and prints the **top 5** most frequent **bigrams** (two-word sequences).

- `Question_3.ipynb`  
  Finds **near-duplicate lines** in `sample-file.txt` by lowercasing and removing **all whitespace + punctuation**, then prints the number of duplicate sets and the first two sets.

- `Question_4.ipynb`  
  Filters `student.csv` based on the given conditions, saves the result to **`high_engagement.csv`**, and prints the number of matches + average grade.

- `Question_5.ipynb`  
  Creates **grade bands** (Low/Medium/High), groups students by band, computes summary stats, and saves to **`student_bands.csv`**.

- `Question_6.ipynb`  
  Classifies each row in `crime.csv` as **HighCrime** or **LowCrime**, then prints the average unemployment rate for each group.

- `Question_7.ipynb`  
  Scrapes Wikipedia (Data science page) and prints the page title and the first paragraph (from the main content area).

- `Question_8.ipynb`  
  Extracts all `<h2>` headings from the Wikipedia Data science page (main content only), removes `[edit]`, excludes specific sections, and saves to **`headings.txt`** (one per line).

- `Question_9.ipynb`  
  Scrapes Wikipedia (Machine learning page), extracts the first table with at least 3 data rows in the main content area, and saves to **`wiki_table.csv`**.

- `Question_10.ipynb`  
  Implements `find_lines_containing(filename, keyword)` and tests it on `data/sample-file.txt` using the keyword `"lorem"`.
